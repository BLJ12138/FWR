# FWR
A lightweight model for underwater laser streak target detection.
# Abstract
Underwater laser imaging often suffers from significant background noise in the form of noisy lightbars, which adversely affects the imaging process and subsequent 3D reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning algorithm named YOLOv8-FWR specifically designed to enhance the efficiency and quality of underwater laser imaging by accurately detecting lightbars in the target region. Our approach comprises three key components: (1) a novel Focal_SPPF pooling module to mitigate background noise interference; (2) a Weighted Feature Concat Module (WFCM) to improve the detection of small target lightbars, ensuring complete 3D reconstruction; and (3) an optimized C2f_Rep module to lightweight the backbone network, reducing parameters while maintaining accuracy. We developed a dedicated dataset for underwater scenarios and evaluated the enhanced model through ablation and comparison experiments. Results show that YOLOv8-FWR outperforms YOLOv8n by achieving an 8.6% improvement in mAP50-95 and reducing parameters by 18.3%. Additionally, experiments on public datasets (VOC2012 and UDD) validate its good generalizability. Finally, we integrated the algorithm with a fixed light window and rotating line laser scanning imaging system, demonstrating its effectiveness through underwater laser scanning experiments.
